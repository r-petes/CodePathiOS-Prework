# Pre-work - Basic Tip Calculator

Basic Tip Calculator is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Rachel Peterson

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Updated UI for a more professional look
- [X] Began implementing a settings page, currently not fully functional 

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of my prework thus far. I have created but not fully implemented the settings page yet.

## Notes

I initially wanted to create an add-on which allows the user to adjust the default toggle tip amount settings, but after several hours of working on that, I have still been unsuccessful in that endeavour. I'll continue to work on that aspect of the app as I learn more XCode skills.
